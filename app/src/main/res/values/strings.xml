            Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon. Eddard also has an illegitimate bastard son, Jon Snow, reportedly
            by a common serving girl named Wylla. Jon\'s presence at Winterfell is a source of friction
            between Eddard and his wife. Nevertheless, Eddard was close to all his children and was
            well-loved an respected by all of them. He seemed to have a soft spot for his youngest daughter, Arya.\n\n

            music. She dreams of being a regal Queen like Cersei Lannister, and that just like in the
            epic songs she will meet her knight in shining armor. She has inherited her mother\'s Tully
            coloring, unlike most of her siblings, and Lady Catelyn thinks Sansa will be even more
            beautiful than she was when she was younger. She is often seen in contrast with her sister,
            Arya Stark who has neither her looks nor her accomplishments in feminine activities and
            comportment.\n\n

            \"You know who I am. I\'m Arya Stark. Do you know who you are? You\'re no one. You\'re nothing.\"\n

        headstrong, fiercely independent, disdains traditional women\'s pursuits, and thus is often
        mistaken for a boy. She wields a sword named Needle, a gift from her half-brother, Jon Snow,
        and was trained in the Braavosi style of swordfighting while living in King\'s Landing. She
        adopted the direwolf Nymeria, but they have since been separated after Nymeria attacked
        Joffrey, forcing Arya to send her away in order to prevent her execution.\n\n
            When her father is betrayed and executed by Joffrey, Arya flees the capital with the help
            of the Night\'s Watch recruiter, Yoren, who gets her out of the city disguised as an orphan
            boy \"Arry\" and tries to take her to Winterfell. On the way, she compiles a list of people
            she intends to kill. However, she is taken prisoner by Ser Gregor Clegane\'s men and taken
            to Harrenhal, where she briefly serves as cupbearer to an unsuspecting Tywin Lannister.

            Without Banners and subsequently by Sandor Clegane. They travel across Westeros as he
            unsuccessfully attempts to ransom her to various family members. In Clegane\'s company,
            Arya becomes increasingly hardened and brutalized, and personally kills a number of men.
            After Clegane is gravely injured in a fight, she abandons him. Long presumed dead by
            many in Westeros and with nowhere else to turn, Arya is now in Braavos, training with
            the Faceless Men. However, as a consequence of violating the assassins\' code, Arya has
            been rendered blind by the guild as punishment.\n\n

            And even then it may not be enough, but at least we give the fuckers a fight.\"\n -Jon Snow\n\n
            Jon is the bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell, the head of House Stark and Lord

            has an older half-brother Robb, two younger half-sisters Sansa and Arya, and two younger
            half-brothers Bran and Rickon. Jon\'s presence at Winterfell is a source of friction between
            Eddard and his wife, Catelyn, although Catelyn put aside her anger temporarily when the infant
            Jon became severely ill. Jon got on well with his half-siblings, particularly Robb and Arya.\n\n

            -Lord Tywin Lannister to Ser Jaime Lannister.\n\n
            Tywin is the lord of House Lannister, the Lord Paramount of the Westerlands, and the
            richest man in the Seven Kingdoms. The Westerlands are one of the constituent regions of
            the Seven Kingdoms and House Lannister is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House
            Lannister rule the region from their seat of Casterly Rock and Tywin also holds the title
            Lord of Casterly Rock. He is also the Warden of the West. He is a widower with three
            children, Jaime, Cersei and Tyrion. Casterly Rock, the Lannister\'s ancestral seat
            of power, is located over a group of highly productive goldmines, which have provided the
            Lannisters with immense wealth over the years and led to the speculation that Tywin \"shits gold.\"\n\n
            Tywin is the son of Tytos Lannister. His father presided over a period of decline for the
            house, frittering away much of their fortune on poor investments and allowing himself to
            be mocked at court, creating a perception of weakness. Their vassals House Reyne of
            Castamere rebelled against Lord Tytos, and Tywin put down the rebellion personally,
            extinguishing their house and re-establishing the fearsome reputation of House Lannister.
            His ruthless destruction of House Reyne was immortalized in the song \"The Rains of Castamere\"
            and gave darker meaning to the common phrase \"A Lannister always pays his debts,\" which
            originally referred solely to the Lannister\'s vast fortune.\n\n

            Joanna was the wife of Tywin Lannister, the head of House Lannister and the Lord of Casterly
            Rock. Joanna was perhaps the only person Tywin loved unconditionally. Joanna bore him the
            twins Jaime and Cersei. She died giving birth to Tyrion. Joanna died when Cersei and
            Jaime were only four years old. Tywin took Joanna\'s death very hard, as did Cersei, who
            holds Tyrion responsible for her death. However, Jaime understands that Tyrion was
            just an infant and had no control over what happened.\n\n

            -Jaime Lannister\n\n
            Ser Jaime Lannister is a knight of the Kingsguard, a position he has held for twenty years
            since he was a teenager, the youngest man ever appointed to its membership. He was
            appointed to the position by the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen.\n\n
            At the conclusion of Robert\'s Rebellion, Jaime\'s father Tywin betrayed King Aerys by
            arriving at the gates of King\'s Landing with the main Lannister army and pleading his
            allegiance, then after his army was allowed inside the gates, turning them loose to attack
            the city. As Lannister soldiers raped and pillaged throughout the city during the Sack of
            King\'s Landing, King Aerys remained holed up inside the Red Keep, for hours maniacally
            repeating the order to \"burn them all\". Despite being sworn by the holiest oaths to protect
            the king as a member of the Kingsguard, Jaime ultimately turned his own sword on Aerys,
            slaying him at the foot of the Iron Throne itself. For this infamous act, he is known
            throughout the Seven Kingdoms as the \"Kingslayer\", to his irritation.\n\n

            -Cersei to Jaime Lannister\n\n
            Cersei is the only daughter and eldest child of Joanna Lannister and Lord Tywin Lannister.
            Tywin is the head of House Lannister, the richest man in the Seven Kingdoms and Lord
            Paramount of the Westerlands. The Westerlands are one of the constituent regions of the
            Seven Kingdoms and House Lannister is one of the Great Houses of the realm. Cersei is the
            elder twin of Ser Jaime Lannister and the elder sister of Tyrion Lannister. She was raised
            in privilege in the family seat of Casterly Rock. She is noted for her great beauty.\n\n
            Cersei\'s mother died when she was four years old, after giving birth to her younger brother
            Tyrion. Like her father, Cersei has always blamed Tyrion for her mother\'s death and deeply
            resents that her mother died so that Tyrion would be brought into the world. Cersei\'s father
            Tywin was constantly away from home during her childhood and teenaged years, serving as
            Hand of the King at the capital, with only infrequent visits back to his seat at Casterly
            Rock. Coupled with the death of her mother, this meant that Cersei and her two brothers
            were primarily raised by servants attached to House Lannister. She began an incestuous
            relationship with Jaime in her youth which has continued despite her marriage. Cersei
            has had other partners but Jaime has always been faithful to her.\n\n

            -Tyrion at his trial, falsely accused of killing his nephew King Joffrey\n\n
            Tyrion Lannister is the youngest son of Joanna Lannister and Lord Tywin Lannister. Tywin
            is the head of House Lannister, the richest man in the Seven Kingdoms and Lord Paramount
            of the Westerlands. The Westerlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms
            and House Lannister of Casterly Rock is one of the Great Houses of the realm. He is the
            younger brother of Jaime and Cersei Lannister. His mother Joanna Lannister died giving
            birth to him. His father and sister hold him in contempt as they blame him for the death.\n\n
            He is a dwarf, causing him problems and persecution. His size has led him to being referred
            to derisively by various names, such as \"the Imp\" and \"The Halfman\". This is mitigated by
            his intellect and his family\'s wealth and power. Had an infant with dwarfism like Tyrion
            been born a commoner, he\'d have simply been left out in the woods to die. However, Tyrion
            was born into a powerful noble House, and was therefore spared. Even though his father
            doesn\'t think much of him, he has had the benefits of being raised with wealth and education,
            and is expected to lead his life as a credit to the Lannister name. He is committed to
            the good of both his House and, since Cersei married King Robert Baratheon, his family\'s
            continued hold on the throne.\n\n

            Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. He tooks the throne through conquest in the war known

            Cersei is the only daughter and eldest child of Joanna Lannister and Lord Tywin Lannister.
            Tywin is the head of House Lannister, the richest man in the Seven Kingdoms and Lord
            Paramount of the Westerlands. The Westerlands are one of the constituent regions of the
            Seven Kingdoms and House Lannister is one of the Great Houses of the realm. Cersei is the
            elder twin of Ser Jaime Lannister and the elder sister of Tyrion Lannister. She was raised
            in privilege in the family seat of Casterly Rock. She is noted for her great beauty.\n\n
            Cersei\'s mother died when she was four years old, after giving birth to her younger brother
            Tyrion. Like her father, Cersei has always blamed Tyrion for her mother\'s death and deeply
            resents that her mother died so that Tyrion would be brought into the world. Cersei\'s father
            Tywin was constantly away from home during her childhood and teenaged years, serving as
            Hand of the King at the capital, with only infrequent visits back to his seat at Casterly
            Rock. Coupled with the death of her mother, this meant that Cersei and her two brothers
            were primarily raised by servants attached to House Lannister. She began an incestuous
            relationship with Jaime in her youth which has continued despite her marriage. Cersei
            has had other partners but Jaime has always been faithful to her.\n\n

            whom he fathered on a girl named Cissy. According to Harrold, childbirth left Cissy \"fat
            as a cow\", so Lady Waynwood arranged for her to be married off to one of her men-at-arms.
            Sometime afterwards, Harrold impregnated the daughter of one of the richest spice
            merchants in Gulltown named Saffron. She is expected to give birth to his second
            acknowledged bastard.\n\n

            by a common serving girl named Wylla. Jon\'s presence at Winterfell is a source of friction
            between Eddard and his wife. Nevertheless, Eddard was close to all his children and was
            well-loved an respected by all of them. He seemed to have a soft spot for his youngest daughter, Arya.\n\n

            Tywin is the lord of House Lannister, the Lord Paramount of the Westerlands, and the

            the Seven Kingdoms and House Lannister is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House
            Lannister rule the region from their seat of Casterly Rock and Tywin also holds the title
            Lord of Casterly Rock. He is also the Warden of the West. He is a widower with three
            children, Jaime, Cersei and Tyrion. Casterly Rock, the Lannister\'s ancestral seat
            of power, is located over a group of highly productive goldmines, which have provided the
            Lannisters with immense wealth over the years and led to the speculation that Tywin \"shits gold.\"\n\n
            Tywin is the son of Tytos Lannister. His father presided over a period of decline for the
            house, frittering away much of their fortune on poor investments and allowing himself to
            be mocked at court, creating a perception of weakness. Their vassals House Reyne of
            Castamere rebelled against Lord Tytos, and Tywin put down the rebellion personally,
            extinguishing their house and re-establishing the fearsome reputation of House Lannister.
            His ruthless destruction of House Reyne was immortalized in the song \"The Rains of Castamere\"
            and gave darker meaning to the common phrase \"A Lannister always pays his debts,\" which
            originally referred solely to the Lannister\'s vast fortune.\n\n</string>
